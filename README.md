## Introduction
This is a code repository of a simply blockchain application for sending transactions(coins). 
The application is developed with ReactJs on the frontend, ethersJs for connecting to blockchain from the frontend and solidity as the blockchain backend.
I also used contextAPI in react to manage transaction state, hardhat is used to deploy the smart contract.
Tailwindcss is also used for the layout of the application.

## Some Features
 * Authentification using metamask
 * Send eths from wallet A to wallet B
 * Record transactions to the blockchain using ethers on the frontEnd and solidity on the backend
 * Get all transaction history from the blockchain

## Added Features
  * Added a getBalance function on solidity to get balance of the connected address
  * Get address balance and display to the user
